        1 – The Development Platform
      </span>

      <span class="body-text">
        The amazing hardware team at SRT created this versatile development platform to test new features and capabilities
        for our encrypted private mobile radios (PMRs). You will notice the handset test platform not only adheres the form
        factor of a handheld radio, but it can also be detached from the platform and be used in a real-world handset when
        needed! This platform allows us to simulate various real-world scenarios, ensuring that our radios perform optimally
        under different conditions. The encryption hardware was an external board that plugged into the handset platform as
        shown below. My role involved developing and integrating the air interface as well as the end-to-end encryption
        functions with this hardware, as well as full standalone and network testing of all the encryption features. This
        platform has been instrumental in accelerating our development process and enhancing the reliability of our PMRs.

        2 – Testing a Group Call
      </span>

      <span class="body-text">
        Me and my team performed thorough testing of group call functionalities using multiple development platforms. This
        involved setting up various scenarios to ensure seamless communication between different radios in a group call
        setting. One of the most critical tests was an encrypted group call where two radios (i.e., Handset 1 and 2 as shown
        below) are equipped with the encryption hardware, and share a common encryption key while the third radio (i.e.,
        Handset 3) is on the same channel as the other two, but has no encryption capability. When a group voice call is
        initiated by Handset 1 or 2, the audio is encrypted and can only be decrypted by the other handset with the correct
        encryption key. Handset 3, lacking the encryption hardware and key, is unable to decode the audio, resulting in
        unintelligible noise. However, when Handset 3 initiates a group call on the same channel, all three handsets can hear
        the audio clearly since it is transmitted in plaintext. This test was crucial in validating the effectiveness of our
        encryption implementation and ensuring secure communication within the group.

  <!-- SECTION 3: Timing & synchronization -------------------------- -->
  <div class="content-section">
    <div class="content-inner">
      <span class="subheading">
        3 – Testing Timing and Synchronization
      </span>

      <span class="body-text">
        Besides functional testing, I was also responsible for ensuring that the encryption-related timing and
        synchronization aspects of our encrypted PMRs were functioning correctly. This involved rigorous testing to verify
        that the encryption and decryption processes were synchronized across different devices, ensuring that there were no
        delays or mismatches in communication. One important test for mission-critical radios is to ensure a voice call is
        set up within less than 250 milliseconds even with any encryption overhead (i.e., getting the correct encryption
        master key, generating the correct derived session key and initializing the algorithm to start encrypting audio).
        Proper timing is crucial in encrypted communications to prevent data loss and ensure that messages are received
        accurately and promptly. Through a series of tests using our development platforms, we were able to fine-tune the
        timing mechanisms, resulting in a robust and reliable encryption system that meets the high standards required for
        secure private mobile radio communications.

        4 – Commercial Handsets Ready for the Field
      </span>

      <span class="body-text">
        After extensive development and rigorous testing using our development platforms, the final step is to integrate the
        encryption features into our field-ready private mobile radios. These radios are designed for real-world use,
        equipped with robust hardware and user-friendly interfaces to ensure reliable communication in various environments.
        Radios used in the field look very different from the ones we use on the bench during development and testing (see
        the two field radios below). My role involved ensuring that the encryption functionalities were seamlessly integrated
        into these radios without compromising performance or usability. When the tested handset boards are placed in the
        enclosure, the final testing can reveal mechanical issues (e.g., press-to-talk button may malfunction) as well as
        thermal issues (e.g., radio response time can get longer or the radio may become unresponsive). Therefore, conducting
        final tests to validate radio performance in real-world scenarios is equally important as developing and testing the
        encryption algorithms on the development platform.
